# Ieee posit benchmark for RacEr Asics

Implementation of a benchmark strategy to be able to measure different metrics on the IEEE-754 floating-point standard and the UNUM 3 Posit standard. Benchmark are carried out on AMD FPGAs provided by AWS. To compare these two representations, we used 3 types of implementation :
- CPU (sequential & parralel with IEEE)
- GPU (CUDA with IEEE)
- FPGA (RacEr with POSIT)

# Benchmarks
## Performances metrics
- Time elapsed
- Stddev
- Bandwidth

## Accuracy
- Error accumulation 

## Algorithms used
- Reduction 
- Gemm
- Dot product
- Sqrt
- Sum of sqrt

Posit was implemented on a RacEr architecture
